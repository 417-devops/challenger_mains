# challenger_mains

The purpose of this project was to iterate through the challenger players and determine their main role (TOP, MID, etc).
It utilizes Casseiopia as the Riot API python library, which was pulling from the match-v4 endpoint.

As of Sept. 2021, the match-v4 endpoint has been deprecated & Cass has a ton of bugs when handling v4 requests. 
Use this code at your own peril.
